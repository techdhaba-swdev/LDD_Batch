COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and led to a global pandemic. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets from infected individuals. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, with severe cases leading to pneumonia and death. The virus has had a profound impact on global health systems, economies, and daily life. Governments worldwide implemented lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures to curb the spread. Vaccination campaigns have been crucial in reducing transmission and severity of the disease. Despite ongoing efforts, variants of the virus continue to pose challenges. Public health guidance emphasizes vaccination, mask-wearing, and hygiene practices. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of global cooperation in health crises. Long-term effects of COVID-19 on health and society are still being studied.
