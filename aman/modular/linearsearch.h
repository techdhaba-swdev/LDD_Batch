#ifndef LINEARSEARCH_H//This is a preprocessor directive that checks if the macro LINEAR_SEARCH_H is not defined. If it's not defined, it proceeds with the code inside the #ifndef block. This construct is used to prevent multiple inclusions of the header file, ensuring that it's included only once in a compilation unit.

#define LINEARSEARCH_H//If the macro LINEAR_SEARCH_H was not defined previously, this line defines it now. This ensures that subsequent attempts to include the header file won't enter the #ifndef block, preventing multiple inclusions.

int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int target);//This line declares the function prototype for the linearSearch function. It specifies that the function takes three parameters: an integer array arr[], its size n, and the target integer value to search for target. The function returns an integer value representing the index of the target element if found, or -1 if the target element is not found in the array.

#endif //This line closes the conditional compilation block started by #ifndef
