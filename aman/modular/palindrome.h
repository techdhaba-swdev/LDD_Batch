#ifndef PALINDROME_H//This is a preprocessor directive that stands for "if not defined". It checks if the symbol following it has not been defined previously in the file.
#define PALINDROME_H//This is another preprocessor directive used to define a macro. In this case, we are defining PALINDROME_H to indicate that it's now defined. This prevents the header file from being included more than once in the same translation unit, which can cause compilation errors due to duplicate declarations.

#include <stdbool.h> //  This line includes the standard C header file stdbool.h. This header defines the macros true and false, along with the bool type, which are used for boolean values in C.

bool isPalindrome(char *str);//This is a function declaration. It declares a function named isPalindrome that takes a pointer to a character (char *) as its argument and returns a boolean (bool) indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not. This declaration serves as an interface for the function, allowing other source files to use it without needing to know its implementation details.

#endif//This preprocessor directive marks the end of the conditional block that started with #ifndef. It closes the conditional inclusion of the header file.
