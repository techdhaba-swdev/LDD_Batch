 Requirements Specification
Requirements specification involves gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional needs of the stakeholders. This stage ensures that all parties have a clear understanding of what the software should accomplish.

 Architectural, Component, & Detailed Designs
This phase focuses on creating high-level and detailed blueprints of the software system, including its components and their interactions. It sets the foundation for implementation by ensuring a robust and scalable design.

 Implementation
Implementation involves translating the design documents into actual code. This phase includes coding, debugging, and integrating various software components to build a functional system.

 Unit, Integration, and Acceptance Testing
Testing ensures that the software functions correctly at different levels. Unit testing checks individual components, integration testing verifies combined parts, and acceptance testing confirms the system meets user requirements.

 Installation and Maintenance
Installation involves deploying the software to the user's environment, while maintenance addresses any issues and updates required post-deployment. This phase ensures the software remains functional and up-to-date over its lifecycle.
