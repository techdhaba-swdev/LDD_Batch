//To debug this program using GDB:

    Compile the program :

gcc -g -o example example.c

    Start GDB : gdb example

gdb ./example

This will launch GDB and load your program example into it.

     let's set a breakpoint at the beginning of the main function:



break main

    Run the program within GDB by typing:



run

    

quit
