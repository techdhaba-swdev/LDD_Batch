-Timelines for task execution
-Budget breakdown
-The team of specialists dedicated to the project (e.g., project manager, designer, developers, and quality assurance specialist)

>>Stage 2: Requirements

-Project logic
-Technical requirements
-Business processes
-Establishing software or product requirements equips teams with the insight and context required for the development and delivery of their software solutions.
