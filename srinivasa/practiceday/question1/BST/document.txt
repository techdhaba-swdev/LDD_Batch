first we have to create 3 diffrent files main.c bst.c and bst.h for modularity code 
for the first file main.c 
we have included the required header files like stdio.h ,stdlib.h, time.h and bst.h
now by clock() function we will know the starting time of the execution
we are giving the required elements to insert into the binaray search tree
now we printing the elements in the inorder travesal order
now we are delete a element a node from the bst.
now agian printing the bst in the inorder travarsal order
now we are searching a key is present in the bst or not
now we are caliculating the ending time ofthe execution of the programe and printing that time to know the time taken for the execution of the programe.
for the bst.h headerfile 
we created a tree structure of data left and right nodes by using the struct node 
we are decleraing the functions we are using inside the programe 
for the bst.c file 
we create empty node as root gives some date to insesrt
now the insert function is called and the programe enters to insert function
in the insert function, first it checks the root is null , if it null it calls the creates a new node in the create function
so the createnode function is used to create newnode to that tree.
in the insert function if the value is grater than root it will enter into the right side and if the number the less than the root then it enter into the left side of the root
this will done recursivly and the binary search tree has been created 
the  fucntion minvalue node  is used to find the node with the minimun value in a given sub tree
the function deletenode is used to delete the node of the tree 
first it will check the root as null if the root is null threre will be no elemnts to delete
if the root is not equal to null it will perform the delete operation accroding the left and right node recurcevily
the function searchnode is used to search the element present inside the bst or not
first it will check if root = NULL and  root data is a key then return the root as the search element
if the key is grater or less than the root it will perform the same function recursivly untill the key is found on the left and right trees 
if the key is not found than it will resluts as the key is not present inside the bst .
the function inodertraversal is used to print the bst in the folow of inorder traversal.
 if we want to print the data in the inoder travesal order we need to print first the left elememts than the middle and the right sub trees.
 after completing the three files we are creating the make file to execute the programe
 after the make file we are creating the profile and coverage files for the bst
