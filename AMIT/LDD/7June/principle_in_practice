DESIGNING AN E-COMMERCE PLATFORM: 
APPLYING MICROSERVICES AND EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE

Scenario Overview:
 we’re building an e-commerce platform called “ShopifyX.” Our goal is to create a scalable,
 resilient, and efficient system that handles millions of users, products, and transactions.

MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE:

1.Service Decomposition:
    Break down the monolithic application into smaller, independent services
   like product catalog, order management, payment gateway, user authentication.

2.Service Communication:
  Use lightweight protocols (e.g., HTTP/REST, gRPC) for inter-service communication.

3.Scalability and Resilience:
  Deploy services in containers (e.g., Docker) and manage them with Kubernetes.
  Autoscale services based on demand to handle traffic spikes.

EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE:
1.Event Sourcing
2.Event-Driven Microservices
->Each microservice subscribes to relevant events.
The order service listens for “order placed” events to update inventory.
The payment service listens for “payment received” events to process payments.
3.Asynchronous Communication
->Decouple services by using asynchronous messaging.
->Avoid tight coupling between services, allowing them to evolve independently.

SOLID Principles:

1.Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
 Each microservice has a single responsibility (e.g., product catalog service manages products only).
 Avoid mixing unrelated functionalities within a service.
2.Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
 Design services to be open for extension.
 Use interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts.
3.Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
  Ensure that derived microservices (subclasses) can be substituted for their 
  base services (superclasses) without altering the correctness of the system.
4.Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
 Define fine-grained interfaces tailored to each service’s needs.
 Avoid imposing unnecessary methods on services.
5.Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
 Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
 Use dependency injection to wire up services.


DRY:
 ->Avoid duplicating code across services.
 ->Share common functionality (e.g., authentication, logging)
   through shared libraries or base classes.

KISS:
Keep service logic simple and focused.
Avoid overengineering—choose straightforward solutions over complex ones.
