**Specification
Comprehensive Requirement Gathering: 
Engage with all stakeholders to collect detailed and comprehensive requirements, all functional aspects are covered.

Requirement Validation: Regularly validate and review the requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and alignment with business goals, preventing misunderstandings and miscommunications.
Design

High-Level and Detailed Design: Develop both high-level architecture and detailed component designs to ensure a clear understanding of the system structure and interactions.

Design Reviews and Iterations: Conduct regular design reviews and iterations to identify and address potential issues early, ensuring the design is robust, scalable, and meets requirements.
Implementation

Modular and Incremental Development: Implement the system in modular components and incrementally develop features, facilitating easier integration, testing, and maintenance.

Adherence to Coding Standards: Follow established coding standards and best practices to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability, promoting consistency across the development team.

Testing and Maintenance
Comprehensive Testing Strategy: Implement a thorough testing strategy that includes unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing to ensure the software is robust, functional, and meets user expectations.
Ongoing Maintenance and Support: Establish a proactive maintenance plan to address bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities, ensuring the system remains reliable, secure, and up-to-date over time.
