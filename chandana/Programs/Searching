*linear Search:
-> Simple search algorithm that sequentialy checks each element in a list a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Time complexity: o(n).

*Binary Search:
->Requires a sorted array.
->Divides the array in half repeatedly to narrow down the search range.

Time Complexity: o(log n) 

*Jump Search
->Works on sorted arrays.
->Jumps ahead by fixed steps and then performs a linear search within a "block" to find the target element
Time Complexity : O(sqrt n)
