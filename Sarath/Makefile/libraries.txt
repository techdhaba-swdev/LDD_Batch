There are two types of libraries we can create 
1)Static libraries
2)Dynamic libraries

Static libraries are ".a" files in Linux and Dynamic libraries are ".so" files nothing but 'shared object' files.
There are some commands to create static and dynamic libraries.They are as follows:

**Static Library commands:

  		gcc -c filename.c -o filename.o  //Compiling file and creating object file
		ar rcs filename.a filename.o    //created a static library

Now the static library is ready to use so we have to use it.we have to create another .c file and create an object file for it too.
now you have to link all by 

	  gcc -o Executable_filename anotherfile.o -L. filename.a  //It links the library 

Now for output you have to give " ./Executable_filename "

**Dynamic Library commands: 

This also created by some commands as static library.As follows

       	  gcc -c -fPIC source_file1.c source_file2.c
	  gcc -shared -o my_library.so source_file1.o source_file2.o  //creates dynamic library(shared object file)
	  gcc main_program.c -o my_executable -L. my_library.so

For output type command " ./my_executable "
