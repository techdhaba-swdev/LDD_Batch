OPEN / CLOSE PRINCIPLE:

--The code defines functionalities through functions (device_open, device_release, char_ioctl) that can be extended without modifying the core structure.

--The use of a character device (cdev) and file operations (fops) provides a standard interface for interacting with the device driver, making it adaptable to different user-space applications.

--For instance: 

:
static struct file_operations fops={
        .open=device_open,
        .release=device_release,
        .unlocked_ioctl=char_ioctl,
};
